/**
 * A marker interface for all DDL queries.
 * <p>
 * A lot of DDL queries come with syntax that requires emulation using anonymous
 * blocks via {@link DSL#begin(Statement...)}. While basic anonymous blocks are
 * supported in the jOOQ Open Source Edition as well, more sophisticated blocks
 * and other procedural logic is a commercial only feature. Examples for this
 * are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Various <code>IF [ NOT ] EXISTS</code> clauses.</li>
 * <li><code>ALTER VIEW â€¦ AS</code> (emulated via a block containing
 * <code>DROP VIEW</code> and then <code>CREATE VIEW</code>).</li>
 * </ul>
