/**
 * A generator can be used with {@link DataType#generatedAlwaysAs(Generator)} to
 * implement dynamic, client side computed columns, i.e. computed columns with
 * {@link GenerationLocation#CLIENT}.
 * <p>
 * There are two types of client side computed columns:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link GenerationOption#STORED}: The computation is performed when
 * writing to a record via {@link Insert}, {@link Update}, or {@link Merge}</li>
 * <li>{@link GenerationOption#VIRTUAL}: The computation is performed when
 * reading a record via {@link Select}, or the <code>RETURNING</code> clause of
 * {@link Insert}, {@link Update}, {@link Delete}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Depending on the type of client side computed column, the exact time when the
 * computation is performed may differ, practically. It is not specified, when
 * it happens, but users may assume that it happens only once per query
 * rendering and {@link Field} expression which references a {@link Generator},
 * independently of how many times the resulting expression is repeated in the
 * resulting SQL query.
 * <p>
 * This API is part of a commercial only feature. To use this feature, please
 * use the jOOQ Professional Edition or the jOOQ Enterprise Edition.
