/**
 * A common super type for various types that can provide a set of fields,
 * similar to a {@link Table} or a {@link Record}.
 * <h3>Ambiguities</h3>
 * <p>
 * Fields may or may not be qualified. Independently of qualification, dialects
 * may produce duplicate fields by name in top level queries, e.g.:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * SELECT 1 AS id, 2 AS id, public.a.id
 * FROM public.a
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * In the above unfortunate example, there are 3 ambiguous <code>ID</code>
 * columns. Only one of them is qualified as <code>A.ID</code>, whereas the
 * other two are unqualified aliases that cannot be distinguished by name, only
 * by index. The behaviour of the various field access methods can be summarised
 * as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #field(int)} will return the expected field by index and isn't
 * affected by this situation.</li>
 * <li>{@link #field(String)} (case sensitive) works only with unqualified field
 * names, and can thus not distinguish between any of the 3 fields. It will pick
 * the first match.</li>
 * <li>{@link #field(Name)} (case sensitive) works with unqualified or qualified
 * field names. Depending on whether qualification is available in the jOOQ
 * result (e.g. it might not be if you're using plain SQL templating, and the
 * JDBC driver isn't able to produce the qualification), the qualification
 * information will be used to disambiguate the result. Specifically:
 * <ul>
 * <li>If the argument {@link Name} is e.g. <code>PUBLIC.A.ID</code> (exact
 * match) or <code>X.A.ID</code>, or <code>A.ID</code> (partial match), then
 * those matches will be preferred over the unqualified match candidates</li>
 * <li>If the argument {@link Name} is <code>ID</code>, then the name continues
 * to be ambiguous, and the first value will be returned.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li>{@link #field(Field)} works like {@link #field(Name)}, except an
 * additional {@link Field} identity check will be used to disambiguate field
 * references. This is particularly useful when using generated code.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Whenever an ambiguity is encountered, a warning is logged to help debug the
 * case. Future jOOQ versions might throw an exception upon ambiguity.
 * <h3>Unknown fields</h3>
 * <p>
 * Not all implementations actually <em>know</em> their fields. For example,
 * when using plain SQL templates ({@link DSL#field(String)}) or tables
 * constructed from identifiers ({@link DSL#field(Name)}), then the fields are
 * unknown to jOOQ and empty lists or arrays are returned, or <code>null</code>
 * is returned on single field returning methods.
